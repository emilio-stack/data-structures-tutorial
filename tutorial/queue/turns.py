    This queue is circular.  When people are added via add_person, then they are added to the 
    back of the queue (per FIFO rules).  When get_next_person is called, the next person
    in the queue is displayed and then they are placed back into the back of the queue.  Thus,
    each person stays in the queue and is given turns.  When a person is added to the queue, 
    a turns parameter is provided to identify how many turns they will be given.  If the turns is 0 or
    less than they will stay in the queue forever.  If a person is out of turns then they will 
    not be added back into the queue.

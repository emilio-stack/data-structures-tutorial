# QUEUES!

Queues are everywhere in everyday life! 
In this tutorial we will deal with two examples of queues: 
* The line at the DMV
* A customer service queue

Queues are fundamentally a first in first out structure meaning 
that the first entitiy to enter the queue is also generally the first to exit.
It is said that they are generally the first to exit because some queues also take into account priority. 
This is to say that if entity 1 in the queue has a lower priority than entity 2, then entity 2 will exit the queue before entity 1.
